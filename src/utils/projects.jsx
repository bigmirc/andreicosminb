      'Another brief was for Castelul de Apă, an iconic monument of Drobeta Turnu Severin. It was recently transferred into a museum hub with an interface appropriate to the creative sectors where we had to participate in an open call of unique solutions. My idea was to use abstract water shapes to create a dynamic and authentic visual identity. For that, I used a modern and timeless sans-serif typeface to represent the creative environment of Castelul de Apă. Moreover, the impact of this project was given by the colours and gradients used to reflect the water waves.',

      'The brief was to come up with a visual identity for a chosen imaginary brand. I came up with SHAPES, a fully eco-friendly, modern and sustainable architecture company that uses sustainable materials in order to provide and create usable long-term spaces. I wanted to provide  a coherent and bold identity, and the logo concept started from a two- point perspective cube cut in different ways in order to get various shapes which makes you think of the different forms from architecture.  I used a strong RGB green for the idea of sustainability. Minimalistic, strict, clean with powerful colors, SHAPES stands for the future. Its purpose is to be focused on digital channels and ultimately to be flexible. A brand’s visual identity that is very strong and powerful in order to stand out in today’s world-where everything demands audience attention.',

The word "ambiant" comes from french and it is supposed to be read like in french which gives the magazine a touch of elegance. Ambiant means surrounding and by that I want to make the readers know that everything that surrounds us is very important and we should pay more attention to it, evaluate and critique.',
